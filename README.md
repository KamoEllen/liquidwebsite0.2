A liquid website is a type of website design that uses flexible, fluid layouts that automatically adjust to the size and orientation of the user's screen. This allows the website to maintain a consistent look and feel across all devices, from large desktop monitors to small mobile phones.

In my example, the body element is set to be a flex container, and the header, footer, and main elements are positioned within it using flexible layouts. This allows the website to automatically adjust its layout to fit the user's screen, ensuring that it always looks great, no matter what device it is being viewed on.
